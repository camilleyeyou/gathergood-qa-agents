# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Every feature in TEST_SPEC.md is tested automatically and reports clear pass/fail results so the team knows the platform is ready to ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: none yet
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-foundation P01 | 7 | 3 tasks | 15 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Test against live deployment, not local — verifies deployed site
- [Roadmap]: Python + pytest + httpx + pytest-playwright stack chosen (versions verified)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 foundation must precede all tests — live DB has no rollback
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Install packages for both Python 3.11 and 3.13 since both are on PATH
- [Phase 01-foundation]: pytest exit code 5 (NO_TESTS_COLLECTED) is correct behavior for empty test suite
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Health check accepts 404 on API root — only 5xx or ConnectError aborts session

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Stripe mode (live vs. test) of deployed GatherGood backend unknown — detection logic must be verified empirically at Phase 3
- [Phase 3]: QR code response shape from live API needs empirical confirmation before writing HMAC assertions
- [Phase 4]: data-testid attribute availability in GatherGood frontend unknown — some selectors may need CSS fallback
